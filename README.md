In order to build the project, first clone the repository. You can do this by clicking on the code drop down mennu and downloading the .zip. After it's downloaded unzip the contents into your desired folder and location. Then boot up Unity Hub. Make sure you have Unity Version 2019.4.28f1 installed with Android build support and build support for whichever OS you are currently using. After that, open the folder using Unity Hub (Click ADD button then find and add the folder you extracted to). Then click on the project to boot into the Unity Editor.

After making sure you are on the right platform, click on player settings button on the bottom left of the build settings window.

Exit out of player settings, and return to the build settings window. Now plug in your android phone via USB and make sure file transfer is enabled for your computer.

Some phones may need specific drivers to build to, so be sure to check for your specific device. Now back to the build settings window in the Unity Editor. In the "Run Device" drop down near middle of the options look for your specific device and select it. Then click build and run. After it finishes building and boots up the app, make sure to allow the app to use the camera. And now you successfully built the app to your phone.
